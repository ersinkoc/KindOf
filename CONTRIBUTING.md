## Coding Guidelines

### TypeScript

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Ensure proper type annotations
- Avoid using `any` type unless absolutely necessary
- Use interfaces for object shapes
- Export types that users might need

### Code Style

- We use ESLint and Prettier for code formatting
- Run `npm run lint` to check your code
- Run `npm run format` to auto-format
- Follow existing patterns in the codebase

### Testing

- Write tests for all new functionality
- Maintain or improve code coverage (currently at 91.82%)
- Test edge cases and error conditions
- Use descriptive test names
- Group related tests using `describe` blocks

### Commits

We follow conventional commits:

- `feat:` New features
- `fix:` Bug fixes
- `docs:` Documentation changes
- `style:` Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor:` Code refactoring
- `test:` Test additions or modifications
- `chore:` Build process or auxiliary tool changes

Example: `feat: add support for BigInt64Array detection`

### Documentation

- Update README.md if you change functionality
- Add JSDoc comments for public APIs
- Include examples in documentation
- Update type definitions if needed
